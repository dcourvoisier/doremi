Description: Provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated
    system experiencing exogenous inputs. The underlying models use differential
    equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to estimate the characteristic
    parameters of the equation (the coefficients) and an estimated signal. The
    package also provides print, summary, plot and predict functions, specific for
    the models outputs.
