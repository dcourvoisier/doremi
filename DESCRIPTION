Description: 
    This package intends to model the dynamics of a self regulated system experiencing exogeneous inputs.
    The underlying model uses a first order linear constant coefficient differential equation and multi-level regression 
    to find out the characteristic parameters of the equation (the coefficients).
    Based on these parameters and the analytical solution to this type of equation, the estimated signal is also generated.
