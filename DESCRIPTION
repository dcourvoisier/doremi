Description: Provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated system experiencing exogenous inputs. 
    The underlying models use differential equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to estimate the 
    coefficients of the equation. With them, the functions can provide an estimated signal and calculate the R2.
    The package provides simulation and analysis functions and also print, summary, plot and predict methods,
    adapted to the funciton outputs, for easy implementation and presentation of results.
