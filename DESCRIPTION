Description: 
    This package provides models to fit the dynamics of a regulated system experiencing exogeneous inputs. The underlying models use differential equations and linear mixed-effects regressions to estimate the characteristic parameters of the equation (the coefficients) and an estimated signal. The package also provides print, summary, plot and predict functions, specific for the models outputs.
